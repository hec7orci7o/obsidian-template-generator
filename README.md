> [!IMPORTANT] Set up your token
> As some templates require a HackTheBox token, it is important that you create and place your token in the indicated places. To ensure it works, you can follow these steps:

- go to the following [link](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/settings) log in to your `hackthebox account` and click on the `create token` button
- In the [[machine]] template, at the beginning of the file you will see a constant variable with the name API_TOKEN, this is where you should paste the token that you got before.
